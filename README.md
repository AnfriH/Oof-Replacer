# Oof-Replacer
A simple script to restore the original Roblox oof/death sound

## Usage
If you're on the Github Website, you can click "Code" then "Download Zip" to download the file. You can then open up the zip file and double-click the .bat file to run it ðŸ˜€
###### After a Roblox update, you may need to rerun the script

# How does the script work?
Simple!
- Navigates to your Roblox install location
- Downloads copy of oof sound from online source (currently sourced from [here](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/6/61/Uuhhh.ogg))
- For each installed version of Roblox (Studio, Player, etc), replace the oof sound with the downloaded copy
- Cleans up any residual files

Tada! Your Roblox now has the original oof sound again!

###### This script only works for Windows and has been tested on Windows 10. I do not own a macOS device and so I am unable to create a ported script

## Is this safe?
If you're concerned, you can read through the file's contents to check for yourself âœ¨

This script uses xcopy and bitsadmin, which should come preinstalled with Windows
